    <strong>Recipes</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a wok until it starts to shimmer. Add curry paste, garlic, and ginger; 
            stir together and fry until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken breast slices, stirring until coated. 
            Cook until just slightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>While chicken is cooking, place baby corn and bamboo shots in a small saucepan, cover with water, 
            and place over high heat. Bring to a boil. Drain then cover with water again.</li>
        <li>Pour coconut milk into the wok. Bring to a slow simmer, 
            stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain corn and bamboo shoots and add in. 
            Stir in fish sauce, palm sugar, and lime leaves. Bring back up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.
